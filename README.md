This repository contains a .net library for consuming XML-RPC web services. It is a port of the Charles Cook's library mainly for .NET Core 2.x but target the netstandard 2.0, so it can also be used on the full .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

## How to use

As a port, very few changes have been done but the API is still the same. The documentation on the orignal projet remains valid: http://xml-rpc.net/

## Improvements

* Can/Should we use Roslyn to generate the proxy implementation of the IXmlRpcProxy interface instead of using System.Reflection?
